# Color-Correct
Basic app implementing some machine learning practices to fine tune color setting files for a printing press. There will be a basic GUI(built with wails). 

The goal is to be able to train this 
model with data from previously run jobs, to dial in press settings before even turning the press on. In theory, this should save paper, time, headache, and most importantly, it should be able to change with thee 
press. When something minor changes mechanically with the press, we should still be able to start up with color files spot on. (will add some examples of the actual industry use).
